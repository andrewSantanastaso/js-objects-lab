Exercise 3
1. Add a new property to the `game` object. Let's call it "difficulty".
2. Choose a value for "difficulty" that you think fits the game. Ex: "Easy", "Med" or "Hard". How would you assign it?


Solve Exercise 3 here:

Exercise 4
1. Select a starter Pokémon from the `pokemon` array. Remember, a starter Pokémon's `starter` property is true.
2. Add this Pokémon to the `game.party` array. Which array method will you use to add them?

Exercise 5
1. Choose three more Pokémon from the `pokemon` array and add them to your party.

Exercise 6
1. Arrange the Pokémon in `game.party` by their HP. The one with the highest HP should come first.
2. You'll need to use the `.sort()` method. How does the compare function work in sorting numbers?


Solve Exercise 6 here:

Exercise 7
1. Set the `completed` property to true for gyms with a difficulty below 3.
2. Think about how you'd loop through the `gyms` array to check and update the `completed` property.
